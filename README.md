# Audio Seam Carver

This project is still in development!

## Set Up Your Development Environment on Windows 

0. Install Python and any necessary Python extensions onto your system/VSCode.

1. Install a C compiler! Look into MinGW and installing `GCC`.

2. In VSCode, install the official Microsoft C/C++ extension.

3. `git clone` the repository.

4. In the repository, create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv` in the terminal, then activate it (`source venv/bin/activate` on Windows).

5. Run `pip install -e .` to install the project and all dependencies to your virtual environment! If everything runs without errors, you are good to go.
