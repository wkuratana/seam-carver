# Image Seam Carver

This project is still in development!

## How to Run

1. In the repository, create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv` in the terminal, then activate it (`.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1` on Windows).

2. Run `pip install -e .` to install the project and all dependencies to your virtual environment! If everything runs without errors, you are good to go.

3. Run `seam-carver`—the test file will be run!
